        <h1>How I Built My First Website</h1>
        <p class="published">Published on March 25, 2025</p>

        <p class="content">
            Creating a website from scratch was both exciting and challenging. Here is what I learned from the experience 
            (and what I’d do differently next time!).
        </p>

        <h2>Why I Decided to Build a Website</h2>
        <p class="content">
            I wanted to learn web development and practice my HTML & CSS skills. This was my first project, and I was eager to see how 
            everything comes together—from structuring a webpage to styling it.
        </p>

        <h2>What I Learned</h2>
        <ul class="content">
            <li>How to structure an HTML document properly.</li>
            <li>The importance of using external CSS for better styling control.</li>
            <li>How colors, fonts, and spacing affect the design of a webpage.</li>
            <li>Debugging mistakes and testing in different browsers is crucial.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What I Would Do Differently</h2>
        <p class="content">
            While I’m happy with how this project turned out, there are a few things I’d improve in the next one:
        </p>
        <ul class="content">
            <li>Use better design principles for a more visually appealing look.</li>
            <li>Make the website responsive so it looks good on all devices.</li>
            <li>Experiment with JavaScript to add interactive elements.</li>
            <li>Host it online using GitHub Pages so others can see it.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What's Next?</h2>
        <p class="content">
            Now that I have built my first website, I plan to continue learning more about CSS frameworks like Bootstrap, 
            and eventually dive into JavaScript to make my websites more interactive. Stay tuned for my next project!<br />
